Scanning the sillouette
-----------------------

- I put the original part together with a meter-ruler on a paper scanner.

- I put the scans into an svg vector-graphic using Inkscape.

- In Inkscace, I rotate, flip, and scale the images.

- I choose the lower edge of the clips to be origin.

- I draw a vector-path ontop of the image.

- I export the vector-graphic svg to scad.
